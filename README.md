# Parameterized Mortgage

A package to provide mortgage functions, built on the Holoviz Param and Panel packages.


## Introduction


This package provides mortgage calculations through two APIs: directly through public functions, or through methods on the Mortgage class.

The package will be suitable for any mortgage-related use case. As it is built on Holoviz's Param and Panel packages, it may be especially suitable for projects involving visualisation and UIs. 

The package also includes a panel dashboard app that demonstrates how the package can be put to use.
